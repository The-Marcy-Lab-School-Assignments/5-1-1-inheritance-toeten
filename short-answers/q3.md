# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism means "many forms". Essentially, instances of the same class can respond to the same method in different ways.

Here is an example:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, catchphrase) {
    this.name = name;
    this.catchphrase = catchphrase;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}.`)
  }
}

class Comedian extends Person {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hey, my name is ${this.name}. Here's a joke: "${this.catchphrase}"`)
  }
}

class Athlete extends Person {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hey there, I'm ${this.name}. My motto is: "${this.catchphrase}".`)
  }
}


const comedian = new Comedian('James', 'The American Judicial System');
const athlete = new Athlete('Ann', 'I do not support the use of anabolic steroids')


comedian.greet(); // output: Hey, my name is James. Here's a joke: "The American Judicial System"
athlete.greet(); // output: Hey there, I'm Ann. My motto is: "I do not support the use of anabolic steroids."

```
