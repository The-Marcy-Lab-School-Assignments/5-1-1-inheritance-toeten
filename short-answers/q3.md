# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism means "many forms". Essentially, instances of the same class can respond to the same method in different ways.

Here is an example:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, catchphrase) {
    this.name = name;
    this.catchphrase = catchphrase;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name}.`)
  }
}

class Comedian extends Person {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hey, my name is ${this.name}. Here's a joke: "${this.catchphrase}"`)
  }
}

class Athlete extends Person {
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hey there, I'm ${this.name}. My motto is: "${this.catchphrase}".`)
  }
}


const comedian = new Comedian('James', 'The American Judicial System');
const athlete = new Athlete('Ann', 'I do not support the use of anabolic steroids')


comedian.greet(); // output: Hey, my name is James. Here's a joke: "The American Judicial System"
athlete.greet(); // output: Hey there, I'm Ann. My motto is: "I do not support the use of anabolic steroids."

```

You are not wrong... what your definition explained could be something like this: 

```js
class Pet {
  constructor(name,type,sound){
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
    this.sound = sound
  }
  speak(){
    return this.sound
  }
}

class Dog extends Pet {
  constructor(name,type){
      super(name,type,sound)
  }
}
const cat = new Pet("Mia", "Cat", "meow")
cat.speak() // logs 'meow'

const doggo = new Dog("Charlie", "Big", "woof")
doggo.speak() // logs 'woof'
```

In this example we are showing what your words are saying!

Your example shows that the method in each subclass can have the same name but the implementation is different! Great way of showing how polymorphism is directly correlated to inheritance!
